# COA Challenge

## Description

This repository contains my solutions for the COA Challenge, which includes an interactive photo gallery built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as two coding challenges implemented in JavaScript.

## Interactive Photo Gallery

The interactive photo gallery is designed to be responsive and adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. It is implemented based on the provided Figma designs, ensuring pixel-perfect accuracy, including layout, spacing, typography, and visual styles.

### Features

- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Image Thumbnail Navigation:** Allows users to navigate through images using thumbnails.
- **Full-Size Image Viewing:** Enables users to view images in full size.
- **Hover Interaction:** Displays additional details when a user hovers over a photo.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Ensures consistent performance across modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Coding Challenges

### 1. Array Manipulation

**Problem Statement:** Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists, otherwise return false.

### 2. String Transformation

Problem Statement: Given a string, transform it based on the following rules:
If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform both operations in the order specified above.
